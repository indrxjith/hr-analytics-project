**Author:** Indrajith

## Overview

This project analyzes HR data to uncover actionable insights about employee attrition, performance, compensation, and retention. It is designed to showcase strong SQL, data modeling, and analytics skills for portfolio and interview presentations.

## Project Structure

- **Schema Definition:** 
  - Dimension and fact tables for employees, dates, performance, and retention events.
- **Data Preparation & Cleaning:** 
  - ETL from raw data, estimation of missing values, validation checks.
